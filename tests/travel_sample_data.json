I paid $89/night for a busy Chicago weekend...the hotels DIRECTLY across the street and down the block were asking $125+/night. All I did was watch an hour of TV and crashed...took a shower the next morning and left. I can't see paying for a lap of luxury in the hotel when there are so many places and things to do up there!

You open the door and you can smell the use of bleach and pledge. It's not overwhelming but it's very clean. The paneling has been painted but the look is a back in time experience our bathroom was all yellow the retro look for today. yellow tile, tub, sink with stainless steel legs...Like I said it was CLEAN.. The carpets are indoor/outdoor and very clean. The bed was comfy. (Sorry No Pool) You'll see that it's the older crowd that stay there (people in there 50's and up). Your away from the highway so the noise is minimal. Being in Chicago it's not in a scarey part of town and is a safe place to stay. We were there for the Paul McCartney Concert at Wrigley so we saw alot of the younger crowd (50 years and up) The air cond. was inside and control on the wall but it was cool. Outside the temp was a heat index of 105 and the room was 72 and we could've turned it down if we wanted. I was totally amazed with the cleanliness and the up keep Retro but Very Nice. Wish I had pictures to show you.",

I recommend that they do not advertise the Wireless Internet until they have their service together. I attended WorkShops during the day and planned to work back at my motel at night. The service frequently cut off Internet Access and I got messages that the Broadband Link was broken, which I did page capture of the \"Broken Link\" message. I tried to use the Internet early in the morning, with the same result. On my last night's stay, I contacted the front desk and the person on desk suggested that I pull my chair out of the room and sit under the router to get a stronger signal. I did this because I needed to work but of course this did not increase my access. They also suggested that I take my computer to the office. So, I hauled my laptop down to the little lobby (where they said I was only allowed to go) and with the same result--no Internet Access. I was told that there may be Internet Cafes up the street. However, I do not know Chicago well and I did not have a car because we carpooled. However, I was willing to go and find a Cafe but I tried to call out on the hotel phone first to see what Internet Cafes might be open and available and only got a busy signal. My only option was to stay up all night and try to put in work whenever I might per chance get a connection. My hope is that management will take their offer of Free Wireless Internet down until they actually offer a solid service. If you are a business person, who needs to have access to the Internet, please reconsider your motel/hotel options.",

I was back in town to do some work and, although I usually stay with friends, I decided to get a hotel for a couple of nights. Since I was using my grant money, I wanted to save on costs so that I can use the money for other things. I read the reviews on here and decided to give the Heart a try. I was not disappointed! I got a large spacious room for less than $90 a night! It is clean, has FREE wireless, and a free breakfast (although the food choices are limited, can't complain about the price!). As a former resident of the city, I can say the location, while not ideal for getting downtown, is very good, especially if you enjoy the neighbourhoods of Chicago, rather than the downtown core. Andersonville is within walking distance, which is a great neighbourhood. Also, the Clark bus (#22) is one block away and this bus will zoom you down to Wrigleyville/Lakeview/Lincoln Park quite easily, or even downtown. Although, if you're heading to Michigan Ave, I would catch the #84 to Bryn Mawr station and take the red line downtown. Essentially, this is a great deal and you will not be disappointed, especially if you like retro things!",

All of the staff is super friendly. The pool area is nice with comfy towels and lounge chairs along with a jacuzzi. The hotel is in a heavily populated area so things are pretty compact and there is not much of a view due to the tall buildings all around. They have done a good job of putting palm trees, etc around to make it feel less \"citi-fied.\" There are many restaurants within walking distance so no need to drive around. We enjoyed \"Silk\" --they serve sushi, and chinese cuisine. Parking is a bit much at $20/day valet or $15 self-park, but comes with the terrifory. Oh yeah, and the warm cookies are to die for!",

Although our upgraded rom wasn't quite ready when we arrived we were given some water and the famous warm cookies and we sat outside for a few minutes in the delightful surroundings of the pool. The room was great, everything you need and very modern. The supermarket across the road was a bonus for buying toiletries etc., to take on the cruise. We walked around the corner to Bebo's Cafe which was full of friendly locals(always a good sign) and we enjoyed an excellant, reasonable meal and a half pitcher of Sangria. We then headed back to the hotel and had a drink under the stars around the pool along with other people who were using the pool or just sitting around. Only thing that could be improved is that the service at breakfast was a bit slow, but we were on holiday so that didn't realy matter. And an added bonus was that we got to meet the charming and very handsome Jose (operations manager) who told us all about his island of Peurto Rico which he obviously loves. Thanks to everyone at the Doubletree.",

The place is so modern and beautiful with a fabulous pool. Be sure and ask for Miguel Isaac, an assistant manager. He is so helpful and knows the area well. We left some items there and he helped get them back, a great person and a great hotel!",

The newly renovated rooms are very clean and wonderfully appointed (w/ fridge and microwave), our breakfasts at Michaels and Under the Trees (both on the property) were on point and reasonably priced, and most importantly, the hospitality of the staff (especially Yodil, Peter, and Miguel) was comforting and delightful. It's approx a 3 block walk to the more quiet \"locals\" beach and 4-5 to the main strip of resorts and casinos. For us it was not worth the $300-450 more to stay on the typical resorty main strip (note that most \"resorts\" on the strip seemed older and much less contemporary than this hotel). Pool was small but clean and while families were there, it was certainly not overrun with kids like others. Ask for Yodil Caban, the General Manager, and he will make sure that your stay is outstanding. These folks don't just talk the customer service game, they live it. As they told us, the smaller size of the hotel allows them to be more personally attentive. It's a $0.75 bus ride to Old San Juan or a quick $12 cab ride at night (note that cabs are more expensive at night so it was probably cheaper during the day). If you're in Old San Juan and want a great dinner in a posh, elegant space, check out Marmalade. Expect at least $40-50 per person, but the chef clearly knows and loves great cuisine (note: this is not local Puerto Rican food, but delish nonetheless). Enjoy!",

On the positive side, most of the staff is friendly and will go the extra mile but two of the receptionists could do with more training on how to greet/deal with customers and the waiter who served us the first (and only) time we ate at the restaurant could gain on honesty. In term of location, I understand it is a great place for surfers as it is close to many spots but that's it. Although many other interresting places (suggested in their handbook) are from reachable distance if you have your own transportation and are planning to do some sightseeing. On the other side, as we tour the hotel on our first day there, we realised (from the view from the restaurant) that it appeared to be still in construction ... however other bits tended to prove that it was either old or badly maintained. A case in point is \"the whale\" a small slide for kids in the pool area. The paint on it is totally faded and in some area the steel even shows. Another review mentionned the plumbing system, and I thought come on, that was until I realised I could hear my neighboor shower, flush their loo ... and that the pressure of the water in the shower also changed if my neighbour was having a shower at the same time. The fact that I could hear all this was a good indication of the soundproofing as well ... paper thin walls and doors and noisy a/c made my nights there virtually sleepless. Oh nearly forgot ... what they say about the critters in and outside the pool is true too ... in the shower next to the pool we were greeted by a cosy spider (in full swing in its wide web) and a dead cocroach and inside the pool ... an unidentified amphibian. I stayed in Puerto Rico for 10 days and I went to three different hotels, this one was the worst ... and for that price, I will not recommend it to any one I know!!!",

The lobby area is very dirty, the floors very dusty. No elevators, and the stairs handrails very rusty and sticky. None of the staff has a uniform, their wear anything they want, any color, any style, and the housekeepers are wearing nurse uniforms. Very unprofessional. And in fact the musty stench in the rooms was so horrible that we could not stay at all. We ended up having to move to another hotel. So please do not waste your time and money.

                        "content": "Let me just say that this was our first trip to Puerto Rico and we LOVED it here. Loved it so much that we have had a REALLY hard time adjusting to home again and we can't wait to come back soon. As far as the Embassy Suites: Pros:1. The room is a suite. Anyone with small children knows this is important. We could put the kids down for bed or nap and still be in our living room talking and that was great. 2. They serve free breakfast every morning and than we only needed a small lunch or snack before dinner. 3. They have a managers reception at night with snacks, juices, pop, and drinks. We stopped here every night before we left the hotel for dinner. It was a great before dinner appetizer that helped hold all of us over before our later dinner. 4. The beach was beautiful during the week. The Embassy Suites section was nice and it was great to have chairs, towels and umbrellas at the beach. 5. The pool, although crowded, was nice and perfect for the kids to play in for hours while I could read a book. Cons: 1. It's not that clean people. We have traveled to a lot of Embassy Suites and this one is by far the dirtiest one we've stayed at. At first glance the rooms look clean, but then you start looking in the corners, at the carpet, under any furniture, closer at the fixtures in the bathroom and you can tell that these rooms haven't been deep cleaned in a LONG time. Gross 2. One the weekend it was crazy crowded. We had to wait 20 minutes in the breakfast line, and same for managers reception. It was hard to find seats and could barely find anywhere around the pool. That thing that was the worst was the cleanliness at the meals during the busy weekend. For example, the bacon tray had more bacon hanging outside on the counter than in the actual tray. I looked at my husband and said is that supposed to be decoration or something? It was gross and wouldn't pass food codes for sure. I understand that they are busy on the weekends but then that shouldn't surprise them, and they should bring in more staff to handle the bigger crowds. 3. The front desk staff were not great. They were friendly, but always talking to other co-workers and I felt bad interrupting them. I would go down there and ask for towels to be delivered to the room, it never happened. 4. We pre-paid for our trip on the embassy website and it said it covers all taxes and fees. They racked on more than $300 worth of taxes before we checked out. I went to the counter and showed them my receipts and they weren't willing to budge at all. So frustrating when you prepay for things. If they have a \"special tax\" then they should add that in when you prepay. Overall we again LOVED PR, an amazing island with great culture and even better Puerto Rican food. I highly recommend going to see El Morro fort, the El Yunque rain forest, going to Luquillo beach and check out all the food stands, and our favorite going to Old San Juan and spend the day there. As for the Embassy Suites, I wouldn't be that excited to stay there again. It worked for us mainly because we were traveling with small children but I would not be that excited to stay there again. Honestly I would stay somewhere closer to Old San Juan...",

Hotel is in a good location (close to airport and cruise terminal) but there is no shuttle bus to either, meaning $20+ taxi rides are compulsory with many drivers adding extra charges for large parties and baggage. Our room was described as a 2 bedroom suite, but was actually a living area with sofa bed and a bedroom with two small double beds. Having a party of 5, a 2 bedroom suite would have been more than suitable, but the doubles weren't big enough for two people to sleep comfortably meaning 2 of us were made to sleep on the VERY uncomfortable sofa bed (so uncomfortable in fact that we ended up taking the cushions off the sofa's and sleeping on them on the floor for 3 nights, something you don't want after 23 hours of travelling.) There were not enough towels, cups, tea/coffee or pillows and it took three calls and a visit to reception for them to provide us with these. When we asked about the beds we were told that we would not receive help due to booking through HOTELS.COM. The bathroom has no natural light so is very dark due to the lack of artificial lighting also. Our room was 623 opposite the elevators, something that made it noisy at night. Can't complain about breakfast, acceptable especially seen as it was free! There was plenty of loungers at the pool but the pool itself was dirty and cold. Laundry facilities were good. Don't recommend the Outback Steakhouse. Our server was rude and incompetent and lost our debit card! She was never around to assist us and the food was very disappointing. Have stayed at many budget hotels that have been more pleasant that this, a hotel that claims to be part of the Hilton group. Being a Hilton Honours member I am very disappointed with this stay and won't be returning due to the reasons above.",

                        "content": "The Embassy Suites is located convenient to the San Juan airport -- it takes three minutes to get there from the airport and ten minutes to get back, thanks to the configuration of the highway system. As another reviewer mentioned, there is no hotel shuttle (there don't actually seem to be such things for any of the properties), and a taxi will cost around $12-15. Parking at the hotel is chaotic--there was never a problem getting a space, but it seemed like we were constantly behind drivers who couldn't work the gate and then insisted on going the wrong way upon entering the garage (it wasn't just us -- we noticed the garage staff seemed a bit bewildered by this behavior, too). Parking, at $16 a day for self park, is less than I've paid at other hotels in the area. I stayed there with my parents between Christmas and New Year's, at the height of the busy season. The hotel was a bit overrun with college swimming teams in town for winter break training, and the fact that the hotel was bursting at the seams showed quite a bit: the line at breakfast and at the manager's reception / happy hour in the afternoon were both incredibly long (forty five minutes for the latter). The first day we were there, the staff seemed to be overwhelmed; by the time we left, systems seemed to be in place to deal with the madness. The hotel is not on the beach - the beach is about a ten minute walk away up a side street. There is a section of Isla Verde beach reserved for guests at the Embassy Suites (look for the flag), where a staff member will provide you with beach chair, towel, and umbrella. Restaurants in the hotel are a bit pricey--we ate at the bar the first night because we arrived late, and the prices were on par with a restaurant in Old San Juan, even if the service and quality was not. There's an Outback Steakhouse in the hotel, which is one of the most expensive places in Isla Verde to eat -- ask at the front desk (not at the concierge stand -- the concierge is a private company) for recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance. There's a Pueblo grocery store next door for basic provisions.",

Room was clean, comfortable, the best housekeeping person I have ever met or dealt with bar none. No request was ever too much. The staff at this hotel, everyone I walked by always said hello, good morning, have a good day...from the valet parking attendant to the guy vacuuming the lobby...now thats customer service. All calls to the front desk for special request were handled promptly and courteously....I mean, the only negative on this hotel is that is about two block from the beach...but guess what...they have their own Embassy area at the beach and the excellent customer service extends there too....I honestly cannot say anything wrong about this hotel, this is my third years coming here and they outdo themselves everytime.",

The pool is large and the kids really enjoyed it, there were plenty of lounge chairs around deck of the pool. The only negative was the traffic noise on the highway overpass located near the pool but after a few minutes the kids noise overwhelmed the traffic noise anyway. The hotel was clean and attractive with a small casino, about twice the square footage of our cruise ship casino with more table games though. The full breakfast offered to guests was very enjoyable and if you are a Hilton Honors member you can even skip the long lines. The manager's reception in the afternoon was nice with tap beer, soda and mixed drinks but could have offered more than just popcorn and chips, maybe I'm just picky. The beach is a short two block walk away with an Embassy Suites concessionaire providing beach chairs and umbrellas for guests at the hotel, a very nice touch. Overall a nice but short stay, would have liked to stay longer. We would definitely stay here again.",

Since my sis and I have never been to PR we had no \"real\" idea about location but this was the Best, especially if you are not renting a car. and wanting to do outdoor adventures and seeing Old San Juan. The bus ride was longer than a cab but only 75 cents is right up my alley! I booked through Expedia (air & hotel from Chicago) although we had a late check in of 11:30 pm the front desk staff was so accomodating in getting us checked in quickly and letting us know the lay of the land. We got our bags into the room on the 2nd floor and headed to the bar. It was a bit disappoinng for my sis that the bar keep did not have mint for mojito's or her type of vodka. He was courteous and efficient in setting us up with our 2nd choice cocktails. We did check out the casino but did not gamble. it was loud and yes you can hear it from your living room but as others have said, the bedroom was quiet. I must express that the beds were fantastic! having a bad back and sleeping on a theraputic mattress at home, I was worried without need. The bed and pillows were so comfortable that my sleep was never affected! The room was clean with plenty of towels. I do wish they would put regular blankets in the closet for covering up on the couch though. The complimentary breakfast was superb! The staff friendly and quick. I can not believe how many people do not tip. I know its included but come on, these folks work hard, have a great attitude and take fantastic care of their guests! The happy hour was appreciated after coming back from day long excursions! Again, Tip your bartender! The only negative I would have is the hot tub and parents who believe that is their childrens bath tub or swimming pool. I did read the rules of the tub and it says \"children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent\" Personally I do not want kids in my hot tub but I am not the proprieter. I would highly recommend this location to those who want to go to Fajardo or the rain forest as well as the other direction into OSJ. We will come back to PR and are looking at the Embassey Suites in Dorado. Thanks for a terrific birthday. One more point~ I think its excellent that management responds to negative reviews here. it shows that they do care!",

                        "content": "I stayed here over New Years with my extended family over New Years. It was very close to the airport, so very convenient, but it was quite quiet. No plane noise. The hotel boasts a multistory atrium and is well appointed. There is a daily happy hour with free beer, wine, and chips which is very nice for a quick snack and a full included breakfast everyday with omelettes, eggs, bacon and much more! The rooms were spacious and as the title says are all suites, with both a bedroom, living room with foldout couch, microwave and refridge. The beds were very comfortable and the room updated and clean with good housekeeping. The pool area was quite nice and although very near an overpass was nicely screened by trees and vegitation. The pool was quite cold, and unfortunately the hot tub was broken for 3 of 5 days. I found the staff behind the desk not quite as welcoming as I'm used to. They were unhelpful in assisting with a printer which would not print in the business center, however the business center was free! $19 per day for parking is a bit high as well. The hotel is a block or two from a very nice beach and has included free towels and beach chairs for hotel guests! There are numerous nice restaurants and inexpensive options as well within walking distance. The hotel and airport are about 20 mins from the fort and the old town area, so a car, bus, or taxi will be necessary to visit these areas. Just for new years, we decided not to do the $89 per person buffet and partied in our room, but the open balconies and atrium allowed us to enjoy the confetti, live music and festivities from a commanding view of the 2nd floor open balcony and atrium. And much new years revelrie was occurring on all the hotel balconies, so was the best of both worlds! The rooms were remarkably well insulated, I think helped by the extra space of the living area, because even though we turned in before the festivies were over downstairs, I did not hear any extra noise! There is a casino inside as well which I did not visit.",

The staff was prompt in meeting guests needs while keeping supplies stocked. We then did some gambling in the on site casino and before we knew it our room was ready. When we arrived at the room it was fresh and clean with a big bathroom, coffee maker and mini-refrigerator. There was a nice grocery store and pharmacy within short walking distance. We enjoyed the bartenders at the complimentary happy hour. They were very friendly. The hotel is a brief walk to the beach, however, we enjoyed the pool so much that we never found the need to go to the beech. When I had a problem with my cell phone, Christina at the front desk was very helpful in locating a sprint store nearby. Nice hotel and staff. Would definitely stay here again.",

Rented a car from SJU and we went directly to Plaza Las Americas to check that out. Got to the Embassy Suites around 5pm. Check in was a breeze. I asked for a room overlooking the SJU runway and they quickly accomodated. The suite was very nice. There were 2 beds for the kids and I slept on the pull out couch. Although, when I woke up the next morning I began to itch from what I can only think were some type of bugs. The kids didnt complain of itching so I was okay and decided I could live with it. Anyway, back to check-in on the first day, we went directly to the pool and relaxed. The next morning, Sunday May 16th, my birthday, I woke up to a note under my door that there was a 5.8 tremblor in the zone of Mayaguex which is about 120 miles west of San Juan. It occured about 1am however I didnt feel it. It woke my son up. I didnt notice any items had shifted. But, what a bang to start a birthday. Anyway, back to the hotel. The breakfast buffet is everything other reviewers have said. They cook omlets to order. Plus, there is bacon, sausage, potatoes, corn beef hash, pancakes, french toast, fruits, cereal, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, et al. The atrium area on the weekend had vendors that were showing their wares(sp). There was even a man who was making pottery with a clay machine. It reminded me of Demi Moore in \"Ghost\". The nice part of that was that he would let the kids try their hand at pottery making. The only downside was Carolina experienced some torrential downpours that flooded the streets and consequently affected the roof and subsequently the pipes which caused some problems. Specifically, there was no water coming out of the shower. I called the front desk and they told me it would be rectified in \"10 minutes\" Maintenance came to my room twice. All told it took approximately 90 minutes. The maintenance man was so apologetic that there was no way I could hold onto my disgust. We did experience the opportunity to eat at the Outback Steakhouse on the property and the staff was great. To be honest, the food alright. The kids loved it though. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday to me in both english and spanish. Another night I got pizza for the kids from the Atrium Cafe. They didnt have any complaints. Because there are so many fast food places nearby, like Church's Chicken, Ponderosa, Burger King, Chilis, et al, everyone should be able to dine on what they want and be happy. I came to Puerto Rico for my 50th birthday and a vacation. Lastly, to have a relaxing good time. And I did. Lastly, the Manager Reception was wonderful.",

                        "content": "Things that I didn't see in other T.A. reviews: (1) There are two pools, an adult pool, and a very shallow kids pool, really more of a toddler pool. (2) The pools aren't heated, and can be quite cold on relatively chilly days. (3) We traveled with two little ones and a nanny, and the suite was adequate size for us. (4) Besides the Outback Steakhouse there is a Noble Romans with (yucky but edible) pizza, hot dogs, and coffee downstairs. (5) Room overlooking the atrium can be noisy, but not all rooms overlook the atrium, so ask for one that doesn't. You might still, however, have a lot of street noise. (6) The free booze at night attracts a rather white-trashy crowd. I'd much prefer if they had less alchohol and some real appetizers, instead of stale chips. (7) Among the restaurants in easy walking distance are Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC, Church's, Subway, Burger King, a Chinese place, a Puerto Rican place (great food, crappy service), Wendy's, and more. The front desk won't tell you about any of these places unless you ask. (8) Don't rent a car to go to Old San Juan, parking is a huge hassle. But if you are going anywhere else, it's likely going to be cheaper to get a car on Hotwire than to take taxis. (9) The area by the kids pool is right by the highway, plus there was a lot of construction noise, not so pleasant. (10) Get to the buffet before 9 if you don't want a huge line. All in all, we had a nice but not fantastic stay. I give the hotel slightly more than 3.5 stars based on value, but I'm sure there are much nicer hotels in San Juan, on the beach, with heated pools, less noisy, and so forth. But traveling with 3 adults, this hotel saved us from having to get two rooms, and we all got a nice free breakfast, so the tradeoff was worth it.",

We ate at a very good restaurant called Don Jose's which is on the main street once you leave the hotel, delicious food. Each night, this hotel offered complimentary drinks, which is a very nice thing. The beach was literally 2 blocks in front of the hotel. If you like beach and R&R, you'll definately want to check out Isla Verde beach. The water was warm and the sand soft. My friend and I rented a beach chair for $4 for the day and stayed there for hours. Our only disappointment was the nightlife for singles...or let me add 35 and older singles:) There didn't seem to be much to offer in this area. Other than that I would recommend this hotel and location to visit San Juan.",

So right after I checked out i went back upstairs to retrieve my GPS and the housekeeper had it ready for me wrapped up in a plastic bag. I was so impressed that she actually held it. I've stayed in rooms where housekeeping or someone or something has stolen my products. Much Much Kudos to Embassy Suites San Juan! (Also....it's a straight, literally straight shot to the beach.

I will begin by saying the staff, front desk personnel,bartenders, waiters, buffet area servers, etc, are all very hard working dedicated people. They are courteous and go out of their way to make your stay to your liking. That being said, I must say that the room quality is becoming an issue. We stayed there last year and at that time I thought the rooms needed some upgrading. They are not lighted properly, very dim in front room area. The sofa sleepers on both of these trips were not worthy to be slept on. We had another couple with us and they said they were just horrible as far as comfort. Also they need to get the latest flat screen TV's. The ones they have are ancient. The rooms just look worn out and need some new decor and brightness.",

The hotel pool is fantastic and the staff go out of their way to help you out. You are also close to Old town San Juan, about 10 min by taxi. Also close by there is a Ritz, El San Juan hotel and and intercontinental. All three are great if you want to get dressed up and go for a great meal, diner and dancing, all with great casinos. This hotel is great value for money. I would not stay anywhere else.",

Very confortable beds, roomy bathroom and accomodating service. The pool area was enjoyable, free internet access, nice bar / lounge area and the lobby was tropical with an open atrium & lots of foliage. Free full breakfast available, including ready to order omelettes / eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bagels, toast, cereals, oatmeal / farina, coffee, juices, etc, etc. More than enough to start the day. Free evening reception which amounted to free drinks for guests from 5:30pm - 7pm. Two blocks walking distance from the beach and other restaurants & hotels. We enjoy walking and after a full dinner, welcomed the opportunity to stroll along Isla Verde Blvd to visit other hotels. We went to two local restaurants: Barrachina & Mi Casita. Both were within walking distance and very flavorful - check them out! Also, we asked them for a recommendation for a local bakery. They gave us directions to Espana Bakery on Calle Marginal Villamar. This bakery is awesome! Only 5 minute drive from the hotel and they had everything from pastries to sandwiches to quiches to hot meals and even liquor. Delicious! We went there the day we were leaving and picked up sandwiches to eat on the airplane. The other passengers were jealous! Down sides - they do not have an airport shuttle. The front desk said that they are not allowed to have it??? Small casino - okay for a novice, but not sure if real players would be satisfied. Daily parking fee for guests ($10 / day). You would think they wouldn't charge guests for parking. An added hotel fee of 9% (or something like that). They attribute this to providing free internet access, free local phone service and other services. Just be aware of this. Not sure if other hotels have started charging the same \"fee\", but the Embassy does. Regardless, we got a great package deal through Orbitz. Over all, service was great. We enjoyed it, and would stay there again.",

Well when we checked into the \"other\" hotel to simply relax and enjoy our last days of vacation, we were checked into dirty rooms, yes more than one and not just dirty, beds made but the sheets had not been changed from the previous guest we were moved to another room and found the same problem. We called Embassy to check if there were available rooms and thank the good lord above they had a room for us. We checked out of the dirty run down hotel and happily waited for a clean room at the Embassy Suites. We had dinner and had the pleasure of being served by the loviest woman that had such gracious and hospitible skills and made us feel welcomed. Later in our room a knock at the door, room service delivering a beautiful plate of sliced fruit with a large bow and an apology for the inconvenience that we had experienced....At Another Hotel!....This was perfect and such a classy touch on what already measured up to be one great hotel. The front desk staff was top notch and I look forward to our next trip to Puerto Rico and another stay at the Embassy Suites Hotel. Thank you for everything...See you again soon!",

First off I will mention that the hotel is nice and very clean. It has an attractive lobby and pool (you are near the airport but the noise of landing jets really isn't an issue). However this hotel is not without problems. The hotel does offer free internet access (as mentioned on their website) and there are three free interent kiosks near the check in desk. However, at least one of them was always out of order and the other two were constantly being used. My biggest complaint with the hotel is their handling of crowds. As mentioned we stayed there on a Saturday evening and the hotel was extremely crowded. The receptionist informed us that Saturdays are always busy because the \"pre-cruise\" crowd. (Apparently, a good number of customers stay in this hotel one night prior to their sailing date.) While the managers reception and cooked to order breakfast have always been some of the best things about the Embassy Suites we've stayed at - these are poorly handled at this one. First off the manager's reception. This hotel has a rule that there is a 2 drink maximum per bar visit. This is a problem if you have small children and your spouse has to stay with them while you wait in line for the drinks. The bar tender told me that I could come back for additional drinks, but the line was long and the wait was about 20 minutes. Also, the drinks are served in small palstic cups which don't tend to last very long. I think that, with additional bar tenders and a little more efficiency (larger cups??) the wait time could be drastically reduced. The same thing happened at breakfast. Very long lines (especailly if you wanted cooked to order foods). The wait was again about 20 minutes and finding a place to eat was a challenge. Finally, we asked for late check out on Sunday morning. Being an Hilton Honors member I've never been denied this request. However, this time I was. After having to prod for a reason why this request wasn't honored, the management finally told me that they had another large group checking in and needed to get all of the rooms ready. They did offer to store my luggage but we needed to do laundry so that wasn't much help. We tend to stay at Embassy Suites when we travel. While I might go back to this one, it was the most disappointing of all of the Embassy Suites properties that we've stayed at.",

                        "content": "My family stayed here on Jan 25, 2005. It's funny reading the previous reviews because we had a very different impression of the hotel. I found it to be clean, comfortable and quiet. Yes, there is maintenance being done, but the workers are very careful and warn you if you are approaching a freshly painted area. The beds are fine, the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable and for one night was acceptable. The breakfasts were fine. Great coffee. The nightly manager party was fun with fruity drinks, and standard junk food of chips, pretzels, party mix and popcorn. The pool was lovely, I can't figure out what people were complaining about. I didn't see any missing tiles and I made a point of searching it out. One traveler said the pool area looked like a hurricane hit it. I can't figure that out either it was simply beautiful. Yes, you can hear the planes either taking off or landing depending on the direction of the wind. After awhile you get use to the sound and you don't notice the aircraft noise. The sounds of the kids screaming and yelling drown the noise out. I don't mind the sound of the kids, I simply put on my headphones and listen to music. It's not as bad as previous reviews write and I consider myself very sensitive to unnecessary noise. The beach is exactly 3 blocks away. One long block and two short. If you have very young kids, this might pose a logistical problem because you need to carry your towels/junk and hold onto kids. I have kids 14, 12,9, so it was no problem. Yes,one of the streets is a highly trafficed street and there is no traffic light. But if you enter the crosswalk the cars did stop for us. No, I wouldn't let the kids do this by themselves. I just don't trust them or the drivers. We walked to the beach and went banana boating which can be found in front of the ESJ hotel. At the same time other kids are on the beach and my kids made instant friends. This worked out well for us. The beach is public and you can rent the chairs for $3-$4 per chair depending where you stop. In front of the ESJ hotel the chairs are $3. This place is good for a short stay and the hotel is designed for business travelers. As we saw mostly flight attendants and business people. If you like the hustle and bustle of San Juan this a decent place. If you are looking for a peaceful surrounding and limited night life you should stay a resort such as the Hyatt in Dorado. The hotel staff is very accomodating and helpful.",

Initially I was put off by the fact that our room had lots of ANTS. The staff was quick to move us to a different suite when we complained about the infestation. So I wasn't a happy camper when we first arrived. I also couldn't believe that a suite which would sleep 4 of us only had 4 drawers and a tiny closet. The drawers were small. But you know what? by the evening of our first day there we forgot all about that other stuff and enjoyed the managers reception-which is free drinks and snacks. The hotel is also conveniently located off the main road which has many souvenir shops,restaurants and a small supermarket. The best place to get puerto rican food inexpensively is La Casita which is in the shopping center near the hotel. I've also stayed at the Intercontinental hotel in the past. These two hotels are 2 that I would recomment. The advantage the Intercontinental Hotel has is that it is right on the beach. The beach is about 2 blocks from the Embassy Suites and easily accessible off the main road . Again overall I was a satisfied guest.",

First of all, the entrance looks like a cheap entrance of a motel, the facilities overall are ok. The pool was clean and refreshing, but the pool bar wasn't open until 6pm and the restaurant too! The restaurant opens just two times during the day: for expensive breakfast (8am) and dinner (6pm). THE ROOM WAS HORRIFYING! Stains everywhere, small tv with poor signal and 8 channels maximum, no decoration at all, uncomfortable mattress, flat pillows, awful bathroom, Hot water! But there's no way to control it so be prepared for a nice burn. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OFFERS OF THE WEBSITE! they supposedly include breakfast and dinner but all they give you is a $10 coupon and you'll be notified at the restaurant about that scam. Exercise area? haha... not at all!!! At least the service was good. It's better to keep this place as a secret.",

The hotel is perched on top of a cliff and you overlook the ocean from the rooms and from the pool. The bar area also has a beatiful view of the ocean. I will definitely stay in this hotel again!",

In fact, i think this was the longest hotel check in i ever had. We had a large room that had a big bed, so it was pretty comfy. Tv functioned ok with good choice of programmes, room was cleand & cleaned every day. Bathroom was little bit sloppy, but still ok. It was clean, but it kind of, needs some refreshment.... Breakfast we had was ok only for first day, already second day you don't know what to take because there is literally only few things displayed... A toast, jelly, butter, some cereals, 3 types of fruit, coffee, milk and juice... Not quite good, isn't it? And thing that really bothered me was the fact that 2 girls \"working\" there ate sandwiches with ham and chese during breakfast time, while guests had their empty toasts. Jummy..... Pool area was not too attractive, right next to reception, everyone on the reception can see you plus there are always some locals swimming, which we didnt like too much. Hotel location was good, close to airport (but far enough), bars, shops and beach which we used few times... Parking in the hotel is not free, but as special guest you have a special price, which was fair. Old SJU is some 15 minutes away (by car), which is ok. If you need/ some evening walks, disregard some previous comments about security in hotel's area, cause it is actually very safe. On the other hand, if you act unsafe, there isn't a place on the earth which is safe enough for you.",

You will pay the hotel for it when you register. Cristina from the hotel was very accommodating as I asked to be moved to another room and it was done at once. Will definitely go back to this hotel.",

Arrived at the hotel at 4:00 p.m. It is a very short drive from the Airport. Check in was a breeze. Rooms are clean and include iron, coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. Bathroom is tiny but clean and renovated. Airconditioning worked well noise level was quiet all night. There is a restaurant in the main lobby selling mostly Italian Food. Food is not bad and reaonably priced. We took the bus to Old San Juan. 75 cents per person and about a 15 minute drive. The bus ride was an eye opener as we drove through what looked like a lot of government housing. Wouldn't recommend doing this at night. Took a taxi back from Old San Juan at the end of the night cost was 19.00 dollars. This was a more than acceptable hotel for a very reasonably priced will definately stay here again.",

It was on the lobby floor which may not have been terrible except for the fact that the room was tiny, you could hear everything that was happening outside of the room and worst of all, there were no windows! It was a dark little dungeon. But for the fact that we were only staying 3 nights, I was very close to walking down the street and finding something else. We did ask to change rooms but the staff stated that everything was booked. The staff, by the way, could have been a bit more customer service oriented. They seemed to have attitudes and were not receptive to questions. The service in the hotel restaurant was terrible. The waitstaff were friendly but the service was beyond slow. They don't acknowledge you when you walk in, you have to just guess that you should pick any seat available. The tables were still dirty from prior customers and on one occasion, we waited approx. 30 minutes before anyone even came over to take our order. It was so bad that we complained to the restaurant manager and we weren't the only ones complaining. On the good side, the pool was nice and the beach is conveniently right across the street. The hotel is nicely situated on a relatively busy strip but having visited Old San Juan, I would have rather stayed nearer to there because they seemed to have a much wider and nicer selection of restaurants than where we were and our location seemed better suited for spring breakers. The bus stop to Old San Juan is across the street from the hotel and is approx. 45 mins, it costs about 50 cents. El Yunque is a must see and I would recommend renting a car a driving there as it's a relatively easy drive and was much cheaper than a tour. Our one day car rental was $27 and the visitors center at El Yunque charges about $3.",

It is similar to the Fairfield Inns on the mainland but a bit more upscale. Clean but smallish rooms and bathrooms. Outdoor pool is extremely private but small with no jacuzzi. One of my customers from the area said the Italian restaurant on the 10th floor is his favorite on the Island. The $20-$30 entree fees are typical for this area. There is plenty of fast food nearby for those looking to scrimp. The internet cafe (35 minutes for $5) was less than 5 minutes away. Several nice casinos are no more than 10 minutes walk. If you want a plush pool next to the ocean stay at the Marriot Courtyard but expect to pay $235 per night this time of year.",

We chose the hotel because it was affordable and the pictures of the rooms and bright yellow Spanish style building won us over. We were EXTREMELY disappointed! Let me first say that... IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES advertised on the internet. The bar and restaurant were closed the entire time we were there. When we got to our room it was hot and muggy because the a/c had not been turned on as a courtesy and the room reeked of some sort of perfume/disinfectant. The table and chairs on our balcony were covered in mildew. The headboards and frames on our beds were not secured, the pillows were flat, the bed was terribly uncomfortable and we woke up our first morning there with bites on our legs, arms and torso! OMG!... The iron was broken, the ironing board cover was covered in stains and don't even think about asking for extra towels or pillows! They acted as if I were asking for their first born! It was two of us and only one small hand towel. I love my sister but neither of us desired to share the same washcloth. Our room didn't get cleaned until late in the afternoon, and again two people, one washcloth. It was close to the airport so we knew we'd hear airplanes go by... but nothing could have prepared us for what we heard. We could have sworn that the planes literally taking off on the same street! We paid $109 a night, but it was worth every bit of $50 bucks a night. I'm a flight attendant and I'm usually in and out of hotels up to 20 times a month and this was by far THE WORST PLACE EVER!!!",

                        "content": "My family and I stayed here from July 12-15. We had 3 rooms booked. One that slept 6 and the other 2 that were double rooms. The room we originally were given had water stains on the ceiling and a very musky smell. Upon entering the room I went to the bathroom to wash my daughters face and realized there was very little water pressure. By very little I mean a trickle. There was no way someone could bathe (much less 6 people). I immediately went to the desk and explaiend the problem. They seemed aware of it but the gist of our conversation was there was no way it would be fixed before our stay was over. I requested another room and was offered one on the first floor that only had 2 beds in it with the promise of 2 cots. The room was next to the bar and extremely noisy. Under normal circumstances this would not have bothered me but with all the other issues this just added to my displeasure here. I called the owner and complained. She was not in any way apologetic and when I threatened to leave she said they would charge me for the 3 nights. The other two rooms were musky and generally in poor condition. I travel to Puerto Rico about 4-5 times a year and have stayed at many hotels both budget and higher end resorts. I wanted to try this place as the website made it look very decent. Basic accomodations are never a problem for me as long as the hotel is clean and the service is adequate. Here neither is the case.This was, quite possibly, the worst service I have ever received. The front desk staff was rude and unresponsive, the manager was just as bad, and the owner was indifferent. I was embarrassed as I was travelling with people that had never been to the island and they were left with a bad impression of the service provided in hotels. If this is your budget then stay at the Coral Princess in Condado. Same prices and much better service.",

We didn't have a prior reservation, but they managed to accommodate us and give us excellent rates. When I walked in, I asked one of the employees regarding their amenities; she included the employees as one. At the time, I was a bit skeptical due to our interaction with other hotel employees, but she was absolutely right. We were treated wonderfully. Donâ€™t forget to try Annetteâ€™s margaritas and Carmenâ€™s Pina Colladas (?). Villa Del Sol is cute, clean and affordable. This place has a lot of character. You will definitely enjoy your stay. FYI, the car rental guy, Carlos (he is not one of their employees), was the only unpleasant person we dealt with at the hotel. You might want to stay away from him.",

We didn't linger & would recommend this for no more than one night. If you're just passing through Ponce like us then why not save a couple of bucks? Downers included mosquitos in our room & the fact that the staff didn't tell us about the parking lot out back until we checked out the next morning. Still, there was only 1 other group besides us at breakfast- more toast or juice anyone?",

We are always looking for interesting places to stay, so we decided to give it a try. The location is convenient since it is located on the Central Square and the \"ice cream\" parlor is definitely a highlight. Twenty-four hour security parking is available, so be sure to ask at check in. The hotel was in fact old and certainly gave us a view of Ponce during its more glamourous years. However, the rooms were disappointing. The furniture is old, which isn't bad since it is an old hotel, but there are stains on the cushions. I asked for my room to be changed when the bathroom floor did not appear to have been clean, and numerous hairs were found on the bed. The room I was changed to was not much better, but since we were only staying one night, we decided to settle in. This is truly unfortunate because the hotel has much potential but seriously needs some TLC and better housekeeping. On a more positive note the continental breakfast was quite good consisting of fresh pastries, juice, and coffee. The staff was also very accommodating and assisted us with many inquiries about the area.",

When we got our keys, accompanied with a generic TV remote, I grabbed our baggage and quickly went to our room to try to get a hot shower after a day of sight seeing. Walking towards the room, I saw that the doors seemed old and rustic; I thought it was part of the ambiance. When I opened the door of the room the hurricane sounding air conditioning was on and the moist/molded/cigarette air embalmed my nostrils with pizzazz. The bed covers had a huge unidentified stain right in the middle of the bed. I quickly took the covers and threw them in the corner of the room. When I do a 360 look around the room, I thought I was in the movie Trainspotting. The walls where stained and cracks where noticeable on the ceiling. When I enter the bathroom there was a blue toilet bowl from the 60â€™s accompanied by a blue sink and blue tub. I have to say that the blue matched perfectly with the blue â€œflower powerâ€� tiles on the wall. I walked back to the room and noticed that they where triangle shaped patterns on the rug. When I took a closer look, I realized that they where hot iron marks. It seems that a several guests left the iron on the floor. After I laughed and told many times to my girlfriend that I was sorry, we laughed and played along with the hotels crack house theme. I went to the front desk to complain about the room and they just stared at me like I was speaking Cantonese. For the record, Iâ€™m from Puerto Rico and my primary language is Spanish. The morning after our arrival we ate breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast was good and I cannot complain about the service. While I was eating, I was looking at the people that where working on the renovation of the hotel. They where spreading a roll of carpet. What was strange is that the carpet seemed old. Then I realized that they where replacing the old carpet with used carpet. Of course, how can you keep a Crack House themed hotel working with new carpet or new appliances. Maybe they just leave the carpet in sea water for days and employ people to intentionally burn the carpets with hot irons just for looks. Overall I have to say that the hotel is a mess, I stayed in the room in the front of the hotel and they seem to be the worst ones in the premises. The staff was nice although the administration keeps the place looking cheap and tasteless. Itâ€™s very sad that on this part of the island there is a limited amount of choices when it comes to hotels or bed&breakfast. My advice is, spend 20 dollars more and stay somewhere else. This is definitely not worth the money. Maybe they should change the name from Perichiâ€™s to Perishâ€™ s.",

                        "content": "My wife and I go to Puerto Rico every year. For 2011/2012 Christmas & New Years holiday we decided to make it special. We wanted to spend it on the island. We had stayed at the San Juan Beach several years ago when they were under renovations. We took that into consideration and put up with the inconveniences, it was a good stay. So we looked at the web site for 2011 and saw what appeared to be new pictures of completed renovations, and booked a 10 day stay. WOW!! What a shock we got when we arrive to find that the owner(s), shifted the emphasis from customer service to greed. The lobby was beautifully redone although simple. A restaurant El Perurrican) had been added, but you must be into strictly seafood (Not much diversity). The free breakfast that was served during our last stay was done away with. We assumed too make way for much better accommodations. WRONG! When we entered the room what a shock we got to find that it smelled musty, was very dirty and with stained carpets. The bathroom was full of mold, mildew, and rust. All the bathroom fixtures had mold, mildew and rust. The window shades were broken so you had to take them down and roll them by hand. The air conditioner (although it worked) sounded like a freight train all night, so we convinced ourselves that it was the sound of the ocean in our room so that we could sleep. We did have an ocean view room (which we payed extra for) We could not get room service to leave us clean towels, and the sheets were not changed. Only the bed was remade again and again for 10 days with the same sheets. I believe we had bedbugs, because we were itching all night an in the morning we both had bites all over our bodies. (we marked the sheets, to make sure). No coffee machine, NO blow dryer although the blow dryer plate was attached to the wall. On the third day we took a ride on the elevator, and were joined by 4 housekeepers. I am Puerto Rican and speak the language my wife is Irish/Italian and only understands it a little bit. Well these 4 housekeepers were discussing in Spanish, how pissed (Encojona) they were that, tourist would not leave the hotel until noon or after, thus causing them to be delayed in their duties. And that they could not find a room on a higher floor where they could watch TV and rest. At check out they attempted to charge us for 10 days of valet parking at $18 a day knowing full well that we only used the valet parking for 7 days, the valets were very good and pleasant . When we did try to launch a complaint the only person we could find did not appear to care about our problems. One employ did tell us that the new management did not appear interested in pleasing the customers only profit. NEVER AGAIN!! Beautiful Condado area, but book at your own risk.",

The only explanation they gave was that the hotel was full and that they run out of king-size bed rooms. In other words, they gave our room to someone else. So we get to our rooms, expecting to get something at least similar to what we saw in the website and so happened that the hotel is undergoing renovations and not all the rooms were fixed. The room we got was worse than what you would get at a cheap motel: Dirty and humid carpets , strong mildew smell, old furniture, no safe box, ornamental phone (didnt even work), the so called \"lagoon view\" was actually a view to a piece of lagoon across the street through a very dirty window. Sleep quality was awful. The sheets were humid to the point of being sticky. The noises coming from the street (honks and loud car stereo) made it impossible to sleep unless you used earplugs. Bottom line: - Poor overall cleanliness. Hallways and room smell to mildew. - Noisy if you get a room with \"lagoon view\" - No breakfast - The hotel has a good location and friendly staff, however, I do not recommend this hotel.",

I picked the hotel because of the location and price. The lobby is real nice it was remodeled and the view is awesome. They have a nice small pool but is a little bit deep for small kids. They have a valet service - $18 dollar daily. If you are a young guy and just want to be in the middle of the night life, walking distance to clubs, restaurants, the real Isla Verde beach and don't mind a motel room. This is the place to stay. If you are looking for a family hotel, with nice rooms and a nice beach go somewhere else.",

When we first arrived, we entered our rooms, to find the overwhelming stench of mold and mildew slap us in the face. We decided to tough out the first night as it was very late and we were exhausted. As we layed in our beds, the smell of the sheets, pillows, and mattress was nauseating. I could only compare it to leaving your clothes in the washer for a month -wet. Then, I decided to take a shower and took my first step into a slimy, tub with a black bottom and mildew and mold stains. Showering in $@!#% flops would not resolve this issue as the shower would not drain. The second stay - we complained about the room, believing that they would clean the sheets, tub, etc, and we would be able to finish the remainder of our stay at this hotel. Instead, we returned to find the same stench in the beds, and dirty bath. Then, we realized that there was living mold and mildew on the ceiling and walls. See photos attached. We then informed the hotel manger that we would like to check out and would not be staying for the remainder of our visit, but they refused to give us our money back. We decided to check out anyway, as this hotel was a health violation and obviously no cleaning guidelines are enforced. I don't recommend this hotel at all. There isn't really a beach view either. Stay in a Motel 6 before here - Please.",

When we asked about the Hotel Service Charge we were told it was another tax. In that situation we figured, what can we do? I took a look at the Holiday Inn Express website and their San Juan hotel right down the street (also in Condado) does not have this service fee. We took a look at the HI Express while we were in town and the pool is smaller than the SJB's, but that seemed to be the only drawback. And the SJB's pool got cloudier by the day, as they seemed to not be caring for it at all. We had to switch rooms after the 1st night because our TV didn't work and you couldn't adjust the temperature on the bathroom faucet. Our new room was only marginally better. And there was one day we came back to no room cleaning after being out of the room the entire day (9-5). At that point we just asked for clean towels for our shower when they offered to clean it for us then. The only food available in the hotel was a continental breakfast for a ridiculous $7+tax. The spread wasn't impressive from the looks of it and I could just grab a better breakfast from a local place for much cheaper. All in all, if I went to San Juan again I would NOT stay at the San Juan Beach. I feel it was way overpriced for the service/amenities.",

If you just need a place to rest your head, stay here - this MIGHT be the place for you. If you have a car - $5 per day. Positives: Staff is friendly and helpful, hotel is located next door to the Wyndam, balcony in the room with views, price was right for us since we did not want to spend a lot of money per night. Negatives: rooms smell of mildew, our toilet flodded day 2 -but we were switched to another room, whole hotel needs remodeling. Stay here at your own risk.",

No wonder people return here year after year! This was our first time, but we will be back. When we arrived for a week in February, the place had been undergoing a process of rejuvenation. Everything was newly painted; repairs had been made; things looked fresh and clean. The new resident caretakers welcomed us and made us feel right at home. They were eager to accommodate our needs, and asked for our feedback. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. The three cottages on the â€œestateâ€� are spread out on a hillside facing Luis Pena Cay and the mountains of Puerto Rico beyond. It is a beautiful natural setting: quiet and peaceful. The sunsets and starry skies at night are spectacular. Each cottage has three units with (mostly) covered decks facing the water. The units are simple, but clean and adequate for two people. The covered deck is spacious and comfortable, with table, chairs and a charcoal grill. The bed is a standard double, and there is no hot water except in the shower, (which was not a problem for us, but something to be aware of). There are no cooking supplies provided (except coffee filters), but we found plenty of provisions at the local grocery stores and cooked most of our meals, with occasional forays out for dinner. The small freshwater pool down by the beach is a little oasis â€“ a place to relax, read and cool off after a day in the sun and saltwater. Although the beach at Tamarindo is rough coral, and getting into the water at low tide takes some practice (there is one good spot at the north end by the pool), the snorkeling is incredible. Green turtles feed in the eelgrass just off the beach, and a colorful variety of reef fish make their home in the coral. There are several other good snorkeling spots, notably Carlos Rosario, and the wonderful sandy beach at Flamenco, very near by. Tamarindo is not a resort and Culebra is not a resort island. For those like us, who avoid resorts and instead seek simple, unpretentious places to explore, swim, snorkel, walk, read and relax in beauty and tranquility, it was perfect! Thank you, Dennis and Gail, for your wonderful hospitality. Hope to see you next year!",
